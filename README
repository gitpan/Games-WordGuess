NAME
    Games::WordGuess - a class for creating word-guessing game

SYNOPSIS
      use Games::WordGuess;

      $game = new Games::WordGuess;
      $game = new Games::WordGuess("/usr/games/lib/fortunes/startrek");  

DESCRIPTION
    Games::WordGuess is a module for word-guessing game. Scoring is
    calculated from the number of chances left for each mystery
    word.

  Constructor

    Specify the full path to the file containing words to be played
    at the `new()' method, for example:

      $game = new Games::WordGuess("/usr/games/lib/fortunes/startrek");  

    otherwise, `Games::WordGuess' uses some internal Indonesian
    words as the default.

  Simple command line user interface

    Look at examples/cmdln script on example of using
    `command_interface()'.

  process_guess()

    This is the core method. Passed a character, `process_guess'
    will return undef if there's no matched character in the current
    mystery word. If it is passed a previous matched character, it
    returns undef as well. On success, it returns 0, or 1 if the
    mystery word has already revealed.

  in_progress()

    Returns the mystery word in current player's progress.
    Initially, after a `Game::WordGuess' object is created, this
    will return the mystery word covered with asterisks. On each
    matched guess, the corresponding asterisk will be substituted by
    the real character.

  get_chances()

    Returns the remaining chances left for current player.

  get_score()

    Returns total score for current player.

  init_mystery()

    Provides a new mystery word to current player. Call to this
    method is required to continue the game after successful guess
    of one complete word.
